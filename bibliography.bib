abstract = {Contemporary industries are generating a huge amount of data coming from a high variety of sources, such as machine controllers, corporate systems, sensors, operators, and more. Therefore, the need for the utilization of the information generated, also known as big data, has emerged. Although data importance is well known, very often in manufacturing industries data are abundant and often underexploited leading to poor performance and efficiency. Big data are part of Industry 4.0 concept and also serve as key element for the Industry 4.0 technologies. But still there is a lot of ground to be covered in the exploitation and industrialization of those technologies. Modeling, design and operation of modern manufacturing systems, where Industry 4.0 technologies are applied, are three fundamental processes in the contemporary manufacturing domain that require constant attention and continuous optimization in order for the manufacturer to stay competitive and improve the efficiency and reduce the environmental impact.}

@techreport{Noy01,
    abstract = {In recent years the development of ontologies—explicit formal specifications of the terms in the domain and relations among them (Gruber 1993)—has been moving from the realm of Artificial-Intelligence laboratories to the desktops of domain experts. Ontologies have become common on the World-Wide Web. The ontologies on the Web range from large taxonomies categorizing Web sites (such as on Yahoo!) to categorizations of products for sale and their features (such as on Amazon.com). The WWW Consortium (W3C) is developing the Resource Description Framework (Brickley and Guha 1999), a language for encoding knowledge on Web pages to make it understandable to electronic agents searching for information. The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), in conjunction with the W3C, is developing DARPA Agent Markup Language (DAML) by extending RDF with more expressive constructs aimed at facilitating agent interaction on the Web (Hendler and McGuinness 2000). Many disciplines now develop standardized ontologies that domain experts can use to share and annotate information in their fields. Medicine, for example, has produced large, standardized, structured vocabularies such as SNOMED (Price and Spackman 2000) and the semantic network of the Unified Medical Language System},

  journal={Knowledge and Information Systems},
  year={2021},
  abstract= "The literature on the modeling and management of data generated through the lifecycle of a manufacturing system is split into two main paradigms: product lifecycle management (PLM) and product, process, resource (PPR) modeling. These paradigms are complementary, and the latter could be considered a more neutral version of the former. There are two main technologies associated with these paradigms: ontologies and databases. Database technology is widespread in industry and is well established. Ontologies remain largely a plaything of the academic community which, despite numerous projects and publications, have seen limited implementations in industrial manufacturing applications. The main objective of this paper is to provide a comparison between ontologies and databases, offering both qualitative and quantitative analyses in the context of PLM and PPR. To achieve this, the article presents (1) a literature review within the context of manufacturing systems that use databases and ontologies, identifying their respective strengths and weaknesses, and (2) an implementation in a real industrial scenario that demonstrates how different modeling approaches can be used for the same purpose. This experiment is used to enable discussion and comparative analysis of both modeling strategies.",

The proposed process simplifies the tasks of the domain experts but preserves the integrity of the design patterns, favoring a well-designed and well documented data model which fosters data reuse. The work is illustrated with a linked dataset of two million chess games, with the key information mapped to other linked datasets and supported by formalized design patterns. This is the first time a chess dataset is presented as linked data, and an insight on its usefulness is given.</p>

      upper-level ontology. This work has the following two goals: to describe the 
      development of the IOM ontology and to guide the practice with respect to 
      documenting of biomedical events, as available ontologies pose difficulties on 
      certain issues. We address the following issues: (i) differentiate between the 
      sets documentation, identification, continuant and explanation, understanding, 
      occurrent as we had problems in applying the available ontology of adverse 
      events, (ii) covering diseases and injuries in a consistent way, and (iii) 
      deciding on which level to define relations.}
