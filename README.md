# UnifiedGuidelinesOntologyDevelopmentForIoP

The first requirement for the creation of semantic models helping to achieve the goals of the Internet of Production (IoP) is to have a guideline integrating enough information and directives on how to develop ontologies, which can be helpful for the actors involved in the process and in this way achieve coordination among them. 

Even though there exist several methodologies for ontology development, there is no single guidebook or template that facilitates the modelling process and saves time for both groups of actors. Moreover, the approach of introducing existing methodologies is neither simple nor user-friendly.

The scope of this document is to provide an intuitive guideline in the form of a digital guide to help Domain Experts (DEs) to create semantic models, more specifically ontologies, mostly on their own but still collaborating with Knowledge Experts (KEs). Also, we present an overview of existing domain-specific ontologies in the production and manufacturing domain and a catalogue of existing ontologies. Reusing existing ones instead of creating a new one from scratch will allow interoperability of the new ontology with existing ones. Our proposed guideline allows both DEs and KEs to work in a coordinated way to create and maintain ontologies efficiently.

To develop this guideline, we studied and unified best practices and existing methodologies used for ontology development. In this way, we support stakeholders who design ontologies to model knowledge on the IoP.
